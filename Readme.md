# Bachelor Project

## Overview
This project is part of a Bachelor's thesis focused on [brief description of the overall theme, e.g., real-time systems and audio-based applications using various technologies].

The project is divided into two main components:
1. **Real-time System**: This includes subprojects involving Mediapipe and Kimi modules.
2. **Audio-Based System**: This involves subprojects using Omniverse and Kimi modules.
