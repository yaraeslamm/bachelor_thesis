# Bachelor Project

## Overview
This project is part of a Bachelor's thesis focused on achieving facial animation on a robotic head (Kimi). The system enables Kimi to mimic human facial expressions in real-time using a camera and perform audio-based facial expressions.

The project is divided into two main components:
1. **Real-time System**: This component uses Mediapipe and the robotic head Kimi to enable real-time facial expression processing.
2. **Audio-Based System**: This component integrates Omniverse with Kimi for audio-driven facial expressions

### Directory Structure
- **realtime system/**: Contains the Real-time System projects.
  - **mediapipeBlendshapes/**: Integration and implementation using Mediapipe.
  - **kimiRealTime/**: Robotic head code for real-time processing.
